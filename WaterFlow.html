		<h2>Water Flow Modeling</h2>
		<p>Once the terrain was properly initialized, the next step was to create the rule system by which the cellular automata simulation would be governed. To do this,</p>
		<p>Initially, many additional features were planned for this project, including a study of variable rain and natural springs as a water sources, water sinks at boundaries, and variable erosion rate to simulate solubility of rock layers. However, due to time constraints these plans were cut to increase focus on the primary interests in terrain generation algorithms and visualization techniques.</p>
