		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>Cellular automata is a useful modeling framework. It commonly finds use in approximating particle system behavior in systems such as lattice networks and biological microstructures. In general, cellular automata is used for deterministic models of simple systems but can be expanded to model more complicated, even probabilistic, systems. Cellular automata's usefulness comes from it seamless application to both fundamentally abstract and heavily applied models.</p>
		<p>Cellular automata is a set of rules applied to a simple tiled space. Classically, square tiles in a two dimensional space are considered, forming a grid with a value associated to each square or cell. The content of the rules can vary dramatically, allowing for tunable behavior. However, usually the rules determine the value of a cell based on the values of the nearest neighbors and second nearest neighbors. The model proceeds in steps and the calculations for the next step are completed before any changes are applied. In this way, each square acts without knowledge of how its neighbors will change or how they will react.</p>
		<p>As one would expect, the behavior of a cellular automata is heavily dependent on the governing rules. The archetypal rule set is that of Conan's Game of Life, a cellular automata system developed as a recreational demonstration of the framework. In this rule set, squares can only have two values. A square is spin up if it is surrounded by two or three spin up squares, and is spin down otherwise. Despite the simplicity of these rules, this simulation exhibits interesting and physically suggestive properties. In particular, the system tends to oscillate between seemingly random and relatively ordered structures. In addition, there are square configurations, known as “gliders” which have an associated direction of propagation and appear to “move” by inducing flips to spin up in front of the glider and flips to spin down in the tail.</p>
		<p>Cellular automata was originally conceived in 1940 by Stanislaw Ulam during a study of the growth of crystals. Though it was conceived as an abstract model with unphysical constraints, the correct physical behavior was observed and so it proved to be a useful tool. Since then it has been applied to model, to limited effect, the propagation of wave fronts and neural networks, among other systems.</p>
		<p>In addition to more practical pursuits, cellular automata has received attention as a point of philosophical debate. James Crutchfield, now a physics professor at the University of California, once rigorously proved that cellular automata models could exhibit statistically significant particle behavior and used this theory to postulate that the standard model could be a statistical description of a fundamentally cellular automata universe. Simultaneously, Stephen Wolfram, now the CEO of Wolfram Research, once posited that the spontaneous generation of order observed in cellular automata systems were an indication of the potential for negative entropy in a physical system.</p>
